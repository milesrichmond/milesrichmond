# About Me:
My name is Miles Richmond and I am currently a freshman at Iowa State University working towards a BS in Computer Engineering. Most of my programming experience lies in Java and C++, but I have dabbled in Swift, Rust, and C. With the exception of Java and Swift, I picked up each language on my own piecing things together from online into small projects.

## Public Projects:
1. [The beginnings of a 3D gravity simulation](https://github.com/milesrichmond/opengl-learning)
   - My goal was to realize a concept floating around in my head that, although not particularly unique, was something I wanted to develop eventually. I wanted some system in which I could explore and express 3 dimensional situations realistically, while retaining control over each detail. 
   - This project is what prompted a deeper dive into C++ programming and graphics apis. I feel it has contributed significantly to my understanding of compilers and lower level data management. It has also opened the world of graphics programming and communication between systems (In particular, communication between the CPU and GPU), which has sparked some interest in driver programming.
   - I want to eventually revisit this idea to finish it off, especially when I have more experience structuring a project.
3. More projects on the way soon... (eventually)
   - I am currently exploring json file parsing, and will release it once it is in a workable state.

I've taken an interest in embedded systems and hardware drivers, although I have not yet had a chance to work in depth with either of them. The most accessable projects to me are more software oriented, and I do not know where to begin for a embedded systems project for my lack of experience.
